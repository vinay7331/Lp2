//Create a base class Employee with a virtual function calculateSalary(). Different types of employees, such as
full-time employees, part-time employees, and managers, have varying salary calculation methods. Explain
how you would implement calculateSalary() in derived classes to handle salary calculation differently for
each employee type.
